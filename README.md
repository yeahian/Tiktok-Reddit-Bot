# Tiktok-Reddit-Bot
TikTok Reddit Post Bot that creates small generated videos from a given text and a background video


This goal of this project was to create simple videos for TikTok by pulling posts from reddit and generating a video from them with an AI voice reading over them. The goal is to speed up the process of video creation using my coding skills and eventually make it so that the entire video can be generated by pasting some text and supplying the mp4 video that plays in the background

---Program directions---

1. Take an input string of text from a reddit post to be turned into a video.
2. Use gtts to convert the text into an mp3 file.
3. Speed up the mp3 file so that the voice sounds a little better than the original mp3 file.
4. Calculate the amount of frames to be selected from the mp4 file that match the length of the sped up mp3 file, starting at a random point.
5. Place the mp3 file over the randomly selected clip from the mp4 so that we have a background video and the new audio playing over it.
6. Now we just take the video, put it through capcut to add the captions, and then auto export to be posted to tiktok

Disclaimer: The program does not yet support captions from the initial video generation, they are created through using an application called Capcut. There will soon be an implementation once an efficient solution is found.
